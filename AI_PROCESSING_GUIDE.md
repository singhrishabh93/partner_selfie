# FLASHOOT AI Processing Guide

## 🎯 **What's New**

Your app now uses **real Gemini AI processing** to generate completely new stylized portraits according to your exact prompt requirements!

## 🚀 **How It Works**

### **1. Upload Image**
- User selects any image from their gallery
- App shows preview of the selected image

### **2. AI Processing**
- Gemini AI analyzes the uploaded image
- Creates a **completely new stylized portrait** based on your prompt
- Generates a professional studio-style photo with FLASHOOT branding

### **3. Download Result**
- User gets a **different image** from what they uploaded
- Stylized portrait with professional studio background
- FLASHOOT logo integrated into the design

## 🎨 **Your Specific Prompt Implementation**

The app now uses your exact prompt:

```
Create a stylized portrait of a person standing with arms crossed, looking confidently at the camera. 
Use the face from the uploaded image. 
Use the provided background image as the backdrop. 
Position the person slightly to the right side of the frame, not centered. 
The person should wear a plain black fitted t-shirt with the "FLASHOOT" logo seamlessly blended into the fabric so it looks naturally printed. 
Lighting should be soft, with a clean professional finish. 
Minimal shadows, modern look, sharp contrast between person and background. 
Final output should be exactly 1600x1200 pixels (4:3 aspect ratio).
```
